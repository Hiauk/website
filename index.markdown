# I am Daniel, a programmer from London.

I am a problem solver, both professionally and in my free time. I have experience building desktop applications, websites and tools in a variety of languages and environments as well as server administration and IoT solutions.

I have a strong interest in topics such as internet privacy, lightweight applications, artificial intelligence, automation and games programming.
